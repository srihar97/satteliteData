## **Assignment Solution: Satellite Data Analysis**

### **Overview**
This repository contains the solution to the assignment focused on analyzing data from five satellites. The analysis is performed using Python, and the results are visualized through a Power BI report.

### **Contents**
Data Analysis Python Script

satellite_data_analysis.py: Python script that performs data analysis on the satellite data. The script extracts insights, performs statistical analysis, and prepares the data for visualization.
Satellite Data

satellite_data.csv: Sample dataset containing information from five satellites. The dataset includes various parameters such as location, velocity, and sensor readings.
Power BI Report

satellite_data_visualization.pbix: Power BI report file that visualizes the results of the data analysis. This report includes interactive charts, graphs, and other visualizations to help convey the story of the satellite data.

## **How to Use**
Prerequisites
Install Python (version 3.x) on your machine.
Install required Python libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn.
Data Analysis
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the project directory.
Run the following command to execute the data analysis script:
bash
Copy code
python satellite_data_analysis.py
Power BI Visualization
Download and install Power BI Desktop from here.
Open Power BI Desktop.
Open the Power BI report file (satellite_data_visualization.pbix) from the project directory.
The report should now be loaded with the analyzed data and visualizations.
Notes
The satellite_data.csv file is a sample dataset. Replace it with your own dataset for a different analysis.
Ensure that you have the required Python libraries installed before running the analysis script.
The Power BI report may require adjustments based on the structure of your dataset.
Feel free to explore and adapt the code and report to suit your specific needs. If you encounter any issues or have questions, please reach out via GitHub issues.

Happy analyzing
